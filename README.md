## üåü Project Overview
I wanted this project to be complete, end-to-end process which goes beyond just training a deep learning model. The goal is to bring the model to user-facing frontend in a scalable and devops-focused way. It takes a grayscale image from a user, uses a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to add realistic color, and returns the result. The entire system is containerized and deployed on a public Kubernetes cluster using Helm, with automated builds and deployments managed by GitHub Actions.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **ML-Powered Colorization:** Utilizes a Pix2Pix cGAN model trained on the COCO dataset.
- **RESTful API:** A simple and robust FastAPI backend provides the inference endpoint.
- **Interactive Frontend:** A SvelteKit frontend for interacting with the model.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Deployed on Kubernetes for high availability and scalability.
- **Automated CI/CD:** GitHub Actions pipeline automatically builds, and deploys changes to the cluster.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The system is designed as a set of decoupled microservices that communicate over HTTP and a message queue for robust, asynchronous processing.

1.  **User** uploads an image via the **SvelteKit Frontend**.
2.  The **Frontend** sends the image to the **FastAPI Backend** API endpoint.
3.  The **Backend** does the inference using the provided grayscale image.
4. The resulting **colorized** image is sent back to the frontend.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | SvelteKit, TypeScript, TailwindCSS |
| **Backend** | Python, FastAPI, Pydantic |
| **ML/Data Science** | PyTorch, NumPy, Pillow|
| **Infrastructure** | Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, NGINX Ingress |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions |

## üß† The Machine Learning Model
The colorization model is a Conditional GAN based on the Pix2Pix architecture.

- **Generator:** U-Net architecture with skip connections tasked with generating detailed images.
- **Discriminator:** PatchGAN classifier that determines if `(input, output)` pairs are real or fake.
- **Dataset:** Trained on a 10,000-image subset of the COCO dataset.
